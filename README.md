## 1. Manuscript Framework 

### 1. Introduction
Introduces the topic of continual learning (CL) and its importance in dynamic environments. This section defines key concepts and outlines the motivation, purpose, and scope of the review.

### 2. Preliminaries
Provides theoretical foundations and a brief historical overview of CL.

### 3. Systematic Literature Review (SLR) Methodology
Describes the SLR approach, including five research questions, literature search strategy, and inclusion/exclusion criteria. The study selection process yielded a final set of approximately 80 relevant papers (2010–2025) for in-depth review.

### 4. Review Findings

#### • Core Challenges in CL
Outlines the primary challenges that continual learning methods seek to address.

#### • Learning methods for CL
Organized into five main categories, further refined into 12 subcategories and 24 subaspects. For each subaspect, we listed the relevant literature and systematically analyzed representative methods, visualized through structured diagrams to highlight methodological distinctions and interconnections.

#### • Settings for CL
Systematic classification into three major classes, further detailed into 12 setting types. For each type, we listed the relevant literature and synthesized key studies, addressing conceptual ambiguities and literature coverage gaps identified in previous reviews.

#### • Evaluation Metrics
Reviews the metrics and benchmarks used to evaluate CL performance and discusses their significance and limitations.

### 5. Discussion
Synthesizes the implications, applications, and emerging research frontiers of CL.

#### • Real-world applications of CL
Summarizes CL use cases across seven domains, including computer vision, NLP, robotics, and digital twins.

#### • Future Directions
Emerging research directions include continual pretraining, task-free continual learning, efficient memory-augmented replay, and unified benchmarking — among eight key future directions.

### 6. Conclusion
Summarizes key contributions: a comprehensive 2010–2025 review, refined taxonomies, theoretical synthesis of forgetting, and an open-source repository.
